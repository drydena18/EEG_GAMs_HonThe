Hi there!
These are the scripts I am using to conduct my honours thesis in Psychology at Ontario Tech University.

Please read the description of each script to understand it's purpose better, and use the comments in the script to understand the function of each section.

These are MATLAB scripts written for MATLAB 2024b, and use EEGLAB 2024.2 to run properly. If any issues arise, check to ensure the versions are correct and that EEGLAB is within the MATLAB directory.
